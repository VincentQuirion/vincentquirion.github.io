I joined [`Gilles Brassard`](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Rh7_srgAAAAJ&hl=en)'s quantum computing and cryptography group! I'll be working with [`Olivier Lalonde`](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/contacts/olivier-lalonde) on quantum communication complexity and quantum cryptography.
